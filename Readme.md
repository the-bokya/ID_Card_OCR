# Digital Image Processing Project (ID Card Reader)

This project uses PyTesseract, Flask and OpenCV to read identity card data. Please note that the data extracted is for a very particular use case and you will have to make a few changes to get it working.

# Installation

1. First install the dependencies: `pip install pytesseract opencv-python flask`
2. Run `flask run` to start the project. Alternatively, you could just use the standalone command line module without the Flask frontend with `python dip.py`
